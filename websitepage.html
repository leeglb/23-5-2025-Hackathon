                        Energy Produced: between 1-50MWe
                        Solid-State Core: no liquid coolant, reduced risk, higher reliability
                        Passive cooling/shutdown: eliminates dependency on external systems: considering an average temperature of -65 degrees celsius on Mars, cooling almost becomes a non-issue
                        Fuel Efficiency: 25-year fuel life with highly enriched uranium; no refueling needed
